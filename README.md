Description:
Imagine a retail store that wants to streamline its operations and enhance customer experience by implementing Python-based solutions. The store is interested in using Python for various tasks, from managing inventory and sales data to developing a user-friendly graphical interface for customers. Here are four scenarios related to different aspects of Python implementation in the retail store:
Inventory Management:
Write a Python program to manage the store's inventory efficiently. The program should allow the following operations:
•	Add new items to the inventory.
•	Update item quantities and prices.
•	Remove items that are no longer available.
•	Generate a report displaying the current inventory levels and pricing.

Question 1: Write a Python program that implements the inventory management system with the specified features.

Sales and Customer Database:
Develop a Python program to maintain a record of sales and customer data. The program should:
•	Record each sale, including customer details and purchased items.
•	Calculate the total sales for a specific period.
•	Provide personalized discounts to frequent customers.
•	Generate a report of the store's top customers and sales trends.

Question 2: Write a Python program that handles the sales and customer database operations as described.

Graphical User Interface (GUI):
Design a Python GUI application using Tkinter that allows customers to interact with the store. The application should enable customers to:
•	Search for products and view their details.
•	Add products to a shopping cart.
•	Calculate the total cost of items in the cart.
•	Place orders and provide delivery options.

Question 3: Write a Python program that creates the specified Tkinter-based GUI for customer interactions.

Data Analytics and Visualization:
Develop a Python program using libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize sales data. The program should:
•	Analyze sales trends over time.
•	Create data visualizations, such as sales charts.
•	Identify peak sales hours and popular products.
•	Generate reports for store management.

Question 4: Write a Python program that performs data analysis and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib, as described.
